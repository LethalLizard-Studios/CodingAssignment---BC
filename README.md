Run the code from SmartHomeControl.java

Right-click on "test/java/org/codingassignment" folder to Run the Tests,
or run each set of tests one at a time. (Ex. FanTest, LightTest)

The system will update automatically on January 1st 1:00am local time.
It will also update any time or date past that if the 'currentVersionYear'
is below the newest version. This is done because updates may come with very
important updates to the device's vulnerability and security, so I feel as though
all outdated devices should always update even outside the specific time.

Instructions are given in the console after running.
Each input must only be 2 characters long
(Ex. f0 turns the Fan Off f1 turns it On)

FAN: The fan has a radial dial-like control for increasing or
decreasing the fan speed. Lowering it all the way turns it off.

AIR CONDITIONER: The AC has multiple different modes including the mode in index
zero being completely off.

LIGHT: The light can be turned on or off by choice rather than it being a toggle
(Ex. if it's on then turn off and vice-versa), this is because if the user
is not in the same room as the light it would be easier to control without
knowing its current state.
