Run the code from SmartHomeControl.java

Right-Click on "test/java/org/codingassignment" folder to Run the Tests,
or run each set of tests one at a time. (Ex. FanTest, LightTest)

The system will update automatically on January 1st 1:00am local time.
And will also update any time or date past that if the 'currentVersionYear'
is below the newest version. This is done because updates may come with very
important updates to the devices vulnerability and security, so I feel as though
all outdated devices should always update even outside the specific time.

Instructions are given in console after running.
Each input must only be 2 characters long
(Ex. f0 turns the Fan Off f1 turns it On)
